## Setup new tools

Recommend to use [iterm2] as Mac terminal.

Libraries needed to install when setting up on a new computer:

After installing [brew] simply run:

    brew install direnv
    brew install selecta
    brew install diff-so-fancy
    brew install ripgrep
    brew install nvm
    brew install pyenv
    brew install chruby
    brew install ruby-install

    ruby-install # see version
    pyenv install # see version
